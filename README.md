This project explores immigration patterns to Canada by analyzing a dataset containing immigration statistics from various countries over several years. The analysis includes cleaning the data, computing summary statistics, and identifying trends in immigration by continent and region, with a particular focus on countries in Africa and Asia. Additionally, the project highlights countries with the highest and lowest immigration rates and visualizes significant changes in immigration over time.
